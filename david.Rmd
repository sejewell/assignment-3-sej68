## Information about David Dayan 
* I am a senior in CALS studying Animal Science and Infectious Disease Biology. I am very interested in wildlife health and One Health and I hope to have a career in research in these fields!
* My favorite animal is either a bobcat or an Amur tiger. I prefer domestic dogs to domestic cats, my favorite animals are generally wild cats (although I do really like wild canids as well).
* I am from Westchester, NY. My hometown is smaller than Cornell's campus in both physical size and population.
